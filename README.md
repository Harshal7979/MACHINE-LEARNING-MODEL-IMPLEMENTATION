# 🧠 Machine Learning Text Classification using NLTK in Pytho

This project presents a simple and effective implementation of a machine learning model for text classification using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) in Python. It demonstrates how to preprocess text data, extract features, train classifiers, and evaluate model performance on a labeled dataset. This is ideal for beginners looking to understand how machine learning can be applied to natural language processing (NLP).

## 📘 Project Description

The goal of this project is to classify textual data into predefined categories, such as positive or negative sentiment, spam or not spam, or topic classification. We use the NLTK library to handle the core NLP tasks such as tokenization, stopword removal, and corpus access. For classification, we employ standard algorithms like Naive Bayes, which is well-supported by NLTK, but the implementation can easily be extended to use other classifieains labeled movie reviews categorized as either "pos" (positive) or "neg" (negative), making it a perfect starting point for sentiment analysis.

## 🛠️ Features

- Text preprocessing: tokenization, normalization, stopword removal
- Feature extraction: bag-of-words model using word frequency
- Model training: Naive Bayes classifier
- Model evaluation: accuracy, confusion matrix
- Extensible design to include other classifiers or datasets

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nltk-ml-text-classifier.git
cd nltk-ml-text-classifier
Install required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install nltk scikit-learn joblib
Download required NLTK data:

python
Copy code
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('movie_reviews')
🚀 How to Run
Train the Model
bash
Copy code
python train.py
This will preprocess the text, extract features, and train a Naive Bayes classifier using the movie reviews dataset.

Evaluate the Model
bash
Copy code
python evaluate.py
You’ll receive an accuracy score and a breakdown of classification results.
